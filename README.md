# Election_Analysis
Poll_Py_Project

Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
The project consists of running an election audit to obtain the names of candidates and the number of votes received in % and total integer number.

Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
    The total votes casted for this elction is 369,711

Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
        County Votes:
        Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
        Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
        Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

Which county had the largest number of votes?
        Denver: 82.8% (306,055)

Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
        Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
        Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
        Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

        Winner: Diana DeGette
        Winning Vote Count: 272,892
        Winning Percentage: 73.8%

Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

As important as it is to vote, it's also essential to obtain the election results promptly. This audit provides the ability to establish a roadmap that can be easily repeated in other counties as well. 
With an established baseline of:
•  Total number of votes cast
•  A complete list of candidates who received votes
•  Total number of options each candidate received
•  Percentage of votes each candidate won
•  The winner of the election based on popular vote

The overall focus of an election audit is already in place. Assuming the CSV file in other counties is similar to that of the election Analysis audit, the code is reusable.
The script can also obtain the number of people who voted, uncounted votes, or the largest demographic of people voting in an election if the data is available.
